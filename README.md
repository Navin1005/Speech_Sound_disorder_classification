A Probabilistic Approach with GWO and ADABOOST for Speech Sound Disorders
This research proposes a novel probabilistic approach for the identification and classification of Speech Sound Disorders (SSD) by integrating the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm and the AdaBoost ensemble learning technique. Speech Sound Disorders pose challenges in accurate diagnosis due to the subtle nuances in vocal patterns. The GWO algorithm is employed for feature selection and optimization, enhancing the discriminative power of the selected features for robust classification. AdaBoost is then employed to construct an ensemble of weak classifiers, thereby improving the overall classification accuracy and generalization on diverse speech datasets. The synergistic fusion of GWO and AdaBoost introduces a powerful methodology for efficient and reliable diagnosis of Speech Sound Disorders, with potential applications in clinical settings.
Objectives:
1.	Feature Selection and Optimization using GWO: Apply the Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm for feature selection and optimization in speech data. The objective is to identify and prioritize relevant features that contribute significantly to the discriminative power for diagnosing Speech Sound Disorders, thereby enhancing the efficiency of subsequent classification processes.
2.	AdaBoost Ensemble Classification: Implement the AdaBoost ensemble learning technique to construct a robust classification model for Speech Sound Disorders using the features selected by GWO. The objective is to create an ensemble of weak classifiers that collectively improves classification accuracy and generalization across diverse speech datasets, offering a reliable tool for accurate diagnosis in clinical settings.

In conclusion, the comprehensive approach outlined in this study demonstrates significant advancements in the domain of speech disorder detection, particularly focusing on dysarthria classification. By integrating cutting-edge techniques such as Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) for feature selection and AdaBoost for ensemble learning with LightGBM, we've achieved substantial improvements in classification accuracy and performance.
Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation on the TORGO 2k dataset, our methodology has showcased remarkable precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics, especially with the proposed "ADA+LGBM" and "GWO+ADA" algorithms. These approaches have consistently outperformed other traditional and ensemble learning methods, underscoring their efficacy in accurately identifying dysarthria cases across various labels and classification schemes.
Moreover, by transitioning to a binary classification framework and strategically preprocessing the dataset to ensure balanced representation, we've observed even higher accuracy rates, reaching up to 99%. This highlights the adaptability and versatility of our methodology in addressing different classification scenarios and achieving superior performance.
Moving forward, the scope of this work extends beyond the confines of dysarthria detection, with potential applications in broader speech pathology domains. By further refining our methodology, incorporating additional datasets, and exploring advanced optimization and ensemble techniques, we aim to enhance the robustness and generalization
